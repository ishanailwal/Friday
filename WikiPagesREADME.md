<h3 align="center">ðŸ“¢ About the Project</h3>

#### This is an Educational project which helps the student to make discipline about their study and get Familiar With Online Study With Proper Schedule.

<br>

<h3 align="center">ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Project</h3>

#### Since after the pandemic almost everything has been moved on virtual world So has Education. All our classes have been moved online and with that all our ***_assignments_***, ***_test_***, ***_exams_***, ***_Viva_*** are being held on the online platform as well, With so many assignments deadlines, upcoming exams dates, and being busy with our life we forget the deadlines and exam dates on most occasion. I don't know how many of you but it happens to me frequently. So I came up with this app which once fed with all the required data it'll remind you of the ***_assignment deadlines_***, ***_upcoming exams_***, ***_unfinished homework_***. So, you can plan your schedule accordingly.
